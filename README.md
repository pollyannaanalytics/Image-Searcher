for Android homework before the first interview at Gogolook.

This app allows users to search for images. When users enter the app, 
they will see all images, displayed in the default layout configured
remotely via Firebase. Users can also input words to search for their
preferred images. The app records users' search history using the
SearchRecentSuggestionsProvider. Additionally, users can switch between
linear and grid layouts by toggling a switch button.
